<p>About me:  I am a devoted husband and father of three.  
    Born and raised in Orlando, Fl.  
    At the age of 18 I entered the Marine Corps and serviced in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in 2003.  
    I'm addicted to sports and exercise having played baseball and basketball as a child and through high school.  
    I met my wife through my best friend whom is married to my wifes sister. </p> 

    <p>I enjoy doing Crossfit as my exercise and competing in various athletic activities (ie. Basketball, Baseball, Crossfit competitions, 5k, etc)
    Spending time with my wife and kids is what I enjoy the most.  Having a 9 year old son, 2 year old son and 1 year old daughter is a lot of work.
    I wouldn't trade it for the world. </p>

    <p> I am now attempting a new direction in my life in becoming a Web Developer.  
    I want to be able to provide for my family while also having time to spend and enjoy with them.
